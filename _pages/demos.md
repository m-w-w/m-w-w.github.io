<p> <center> <h1>Experiment demos</h1> </center> </p>
These are free tools for educators. In my music cognition course, students completed a short experiment demo related to each assigned reading. Later, in pairs, they analyzed and presented the class results along with the article. When I have time, I'll add to this list. If you have a demo request, please **[reach out](mailto:michael.weiss@umontreal.ca)**, especially if you have permission to share stimuli.

Format: 
* For each demo, there's a link to a short online task. 
* At the end of the task, participants can see their performance and download their results as a CSV file. If they choose to provide a name or ID, it will be included in the CSV file.
* The CSV files can be submitted to the instructor.
* The instructor can analyze/visualize the results of the group using the provided R script, and see a list of names/IDs. I tried to make this part easyâ€”just put the files in the same folder and run the script.
