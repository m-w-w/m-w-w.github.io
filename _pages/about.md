I'm a postdoc in the [Peretz Lab](http://www.peretzlab.ca/) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Montreal. I'm also affiliated with the [International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research (BRAMS)](https://www.brams.org), and the [Centre for Research on Brain, Language, and Music (CRBLM)](http://crblm.ca/).

I study how we learn and remember musical information, and the nature of that knowledge. I'm also interested in how musicality differs across individuals and across development.
