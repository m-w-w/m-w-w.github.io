This is a brief (~5 min) demonstration of "good pitch memory" for famous recordings. It's based on a study by [Schellenberg and Trehub (2003).](https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.03432)

The task is aimed at students but open to all. It uses short clips of popular music, primarily TV theme songs. There are 16 trials total, with 8 excerpts heard twice each. On each trial, one of the clips was shifted in Audacity by 1 semitone (up or down). The other was shifted up and then back to the original level so that sound processing artifacts shouldn't give away the answer.

No personal data will be logged from your participation, but you have the option to enter a name or ID which will be saved in your CSV file.
